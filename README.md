# BasicCNNProject
Classification of cat and dog pictures using Convolutional Neural Network. Cats and dogs dataset in kaggle is used for training and testing.

# Usage
In order to use it, first you should change kaggle username and key information in main.ipynb. Secondly you should be aware of using a Linux distribution or google colab(to install dataset). If you have already installed dataset you can skip this part. All part which should be executed is main.ipynb file. Other are helper methods and classes.

# Results
I made all training on google colab and save loss results and accuracy results. You can find them in models folder
